# Dino Kennel
This was is the cohorts milestone project for cohort EC13. It is a single page application that allows the user to interact with dinosaurs. The user can do the following:

 - Pet Dinos
 - Feed Dinos
 - Send Dinos on an adventure
 - Delete Dinos

Each interaction with the dino will result in energy being taken away from the dino or energy being added to the dino. Based on the dino's energy level they will be automatically placed in different areas of the application. Healthy dinos reside in the kennel, sick dinos reside in the hospital, and dead dinos reside in the graveyard.
